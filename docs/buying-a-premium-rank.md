# Buying a Premium Rank

To buy a rank, open the NetherGames Store.

Please choose one of the ranks above to view its price, perks, and eligibility.

::: info PLEASE NOTE
If you already own Ultra or Emerald, upgrading your rank to a higher one is discounted so that you would pay the same price you would've if you bought that higher rank orginally.
:::

You can either buy the rank for yourself or create a gift code to be used by other players.

## Buying for yourself

Currently, we support card payments from major brands such as Mastercard, Visa, American Express, and PayPal.
You can also autocomplete your card information for future purchases using Google Pay or Apple Pay if supported on your device.

::: tip Customers from India
We regret to inform our Indian customers that we currently do not accept RuPay or UPI. Customers from India will need to try an alternative credit/debit card or ask a friend for assistance when making their purchase. We are working on supporting RuPay and UPI in the future, but cannot provide a time/date when this will be available. At this time do not accept Google Play or other types of gift cards.
