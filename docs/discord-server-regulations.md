# Discord Server Regulations

::: warning PLEASE NOTE
You must be at least 13 years old to hold a Discord account. We will ban underage users per [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
:::

While registered in our [Discord server](https://ngmc.co/discord), we expect you to adhere to our regulations as listed below. Failure to follow these expectations will result in a warning or a punishment issued where deemed necessary at our discretion.

## Regulations

**1. No swearing/profanity or discrimination**

You may not use foul language directed at a specific user or anywhere in the Discord server. Discrimination or inappropriate comments against a particular race, gender, or user are prohibited.

Offenders will be issued a warning under this regulation. Depending on the severity of the offence we may issue a permanent ban without notice.

**2. Do not unnecessarily ping or contact others**

You may only ping others with a valid reason, especially staff members. If you have a question, please contact @Modmail, where a staff member will reply to your queries as soon as possible.

Offenders will be issued a warning under this regulation.

**3. No advertising**

You may not advertise/promote Discord servers or other programs, websites, or services. This rule includes direct messaging unsolicited invites. However, you may share Discord servers that are related to NetherGames - such as guild servers.

Offenders will be issued a warning under this regulation.

**4. Keep personal information safe**

Please do not post personally identifiable information to Discord or share it with others. Our server is not a secure environment to share private information with other unknown internet users.

**5. No inappropriate content**

You may not post content commonly deemed inappropriate. Ask yourself, is this something my parents would like to see? If not, do not post the material in question. Content that others may find offensive is also prohibited.

Offenders will be issued a warning under this regulation.

**6. No spamming**

You may not repeatedly repeat the same word or phrase to gain attention or annoy other users. The rule also includes posting chunks of nonsense text or chain messages that are mostly spam.

Offenders will be issued a warning under this regulation.

**7. No evading bans or assisting ban evaders**

You may not evade your punishment or assist another user in evading theirs. There are appropriate systems in place to stop offenders, and you are obliged to respect the judgment of our staff members.

We immediately ban offenders under this regulation.

**8. Follow Discord policies**

You must follow [Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines[(https://dis.gd/tos) while using the NetherGames Discord server.

## Warnings system

A 24-hour mute will be issued once a user has reached three warnings, and a permanent ban will be issued once a user gets six warnings.

Suppose you need clarification about what type of activity or behaviour is allowed. In that case, we encourage you to contact our support team through Modmail on our [Discord server](https://ngmc.co/discord).

We reserve the right to change these rules without prior notice or consultation with the broader community, which may come into effect immediately. We may also exercise the right to ban and refuse service or limit service access to any user at our discretion, regardless of whether they have broken the above regulations.

Thanks for using the NetherGames Discord server - we hope to see you soon!
